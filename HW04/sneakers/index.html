                    <p class="so-p bai-jamjuree-regular">In June this year, hundreds of Australian shoppers queued – some  overnight – to buy a pair of Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Black Static Adidas sneakers the moment they went on sale. Before lining up, customers had to register and go into a draw to determine whether they could buy a pair. The shoes sold for a few hundred dollars but are now being traded for up to a $3000. This quest to obtain limited edition sneakers designed by rapper Kanye West is not an isolated phenomenon. People have long gone to extreme lengths to get their hands on the latest kicks. There have been reports of sneaker violence since the 1980s.

                    <p class="st-p bai-jamjuree-regular"> The first sneakers appeared in 1830s England, when Liverpool Rubber bonded a canvas outer onto a vulcanised rubber sole, creating the original sand shoe for the Victorian middle classes to wear on the beach. Different styles of the shoe were developed in the UK and the US throughout the 19th century to respond to athletic pursuits like running, tennis, jumping and sailing. The term “sneaker” was coined in the US in the 1870 to describe the shoe because it was noiseless. Athletes in Paris wore sneakers at the first modern Olympic Games in 1900.</p>

                    <p class="sth-p bai-jamjuree-regular">The current nostalgia in sneakers extends to design imagery, styles, and colour combinations. In April this year, Adidas issued a limited edition version of the My Adidas Superstar 1986 sneaker. <br>
                    Luxury brands have also taken note, capitalising on historical references, status concerns and a relaxation in social dress codes.
                    Leading high-fashion brands, including Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga now consider sneakers a must-have fashion item in their collections. Where once 1980s women swapped their commuter sneakers for power heels at the office, people now wear their sneakers all day.</p>

                    <h2 class="sf-h bai-jamjuree-medium">Sustainability and ethical production</h2>
                    <p class="sf-p bai-jamjuree-regular">While many sneaker fans continue to prioritise style over environmental concerns, others are demanding transparency around the ethics and impact of production, leading to the rise of the sustainable sneaker. Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, favours Veja sneakers made from wild Amazonian rainforest rubber. Adidas has been making sneakers using recycled ocean plastic since 2015, but says it wants to go further. It launched the Futurecraft Loop in April, a sneaker made exclusively from 100% reusable Thermoplastic polyurethane that can be recycled again and again.</p>

                            The attitude of kindness is everyday stuff like a great pair of sneakers. Not frilly. Not fancy. Just plain and comfortable.

                        Converse Chuck Taylor <br> All-Stars, first marketed in <br> 1917, are the all-time <br> best-selling sneakers, with total sales nearing 600 <br> million pairs.

                    <h2 class="sfv-h bai-jamjuree-medium">Supply and demand</h2>
                    <p class="sfv-p bai-jamjuree-regular">One key to enduring sneaker love is scarcity. Adidas only released 1986 of their limited-edition My Adidas Superstar 1986 shoes. West also generates exclusivity with low production numbers – only 40,000 pairs of Yeezys are made worldwide for each drop and shops in Australia may only have 25 pairs of each incarnation. The combination of rarity, and the myriad cultural meanings embedded in sneakers creates an emotional pull for collectors like DJ Jerome Salele’a that ties them to sneaker, hip-hop, skater and rave communities around the globe. The ultimate sneaker is a comfortable vehicle for the body to move through the world that expresses the wearer’s desires, dreams and aspirations and crosses social, geographic and language boundaries.</p>
